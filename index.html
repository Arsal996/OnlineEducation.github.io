                Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives,
                and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly
                divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as
                addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements,but in a more flexible
                 manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education
                 occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be 
                considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. </p>
